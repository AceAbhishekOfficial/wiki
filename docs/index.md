Welcome to the open.mp wiki!

Most of the core API documentation is here. We welcome contributions for improvements to documentation as well as tutorials and guides for common tasks such as building simple gamemodes and using common libraries and plugins. If you're interested in contributing then head over to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/openmultiplayer/wiki).
