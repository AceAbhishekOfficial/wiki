Welcome to the open.mp wiki!

This is a work-in-progress site aimed at providing an easily accessible, easy to contribute to documentation source for open.mp and SA-MP. Some SA-MP specific pages are not here yet and can be found [on the old wiki](https://wiki.sa-mp.com/). If you believe a page from the old wiki should be moved here (either copied as-is or updated), please open an issue to let us know or even better, a pull-request with the newly updated page!

Most of the core API documentation is here. We welcome contributions for improvements to documentation as well as tutorials and guides for common tasks such as building simple gamemodes and using common libraries and plugins. If you're interested in contributing then head over to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/openmultiplayer/wiki).
